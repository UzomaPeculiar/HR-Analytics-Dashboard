## Project Overview
This dashboard was designed to analyze workforce data and provide actionable HR insights. It helps track employee distribution, demographics, attrition trends, and performance-related metrics. The goal is to give HR managers a clear view of workforce composition and areas requiring attention.

## Data Sources
- **HR Dataset** (internal employee records)  
  - Contains fields such as employee demographics, job role, department, performance ratings, and attrition status.  

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: Visualization and dashboard building  
- **Power Query**: Data preparation, cleaning, and transformation  

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
1. Removed duplicate employee records  
2. Standardized categorical fields (e.g., department names, job roles)  
3. Addressed missing values in performance and attrition columns  
4. Converted date fields (hire date, exit date) into `DateTime` format  

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key questions explored:  
1. What is the overall attrition rate?  
2. Which departments face the highest attrition?  
3. How does attrition vary by age, gender, and job role?  
4. What is the correlation between performance rating and attrition?
